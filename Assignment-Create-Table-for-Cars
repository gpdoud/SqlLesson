Assignment: Create the cars list

Note: for this assignment, you should create a new repository in both Git and GitHub and place your work in the repository

Create a table that will hold a list of the cars you've owned currently and in the past.

The table should have these columns:

1. An [integer] primary key; unique for each one
2. Make: [string 30] the manufacturer
3. Model: [string 30] the particular car for that manufacturer
4. Trim: [string 10] LX, EX, etc. (if exists)
5. Year: [integer] The year of the vehicle
6. IsSedan: [boolean] True or False
7. PurchasePrice: [decimal 2 decimal positions] currency; how much you paid (estimated if you don't remember)

Once the table is created, insert as many of your cars as you can remember
